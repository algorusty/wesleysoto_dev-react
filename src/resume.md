## Summary

Spearheading by automating the job I started with under the UHG umbrella, I led automation processes at Optum, achieving $572K in capital cost savings and $210K in annual recurring costs. With a 4-year non-linear track record in AI-integrated solutioning at UHG, I specialize in crafting productive architectures using Python, Node.js, TypeScript and Rust. My path of automation has a projected impact of $3M+ in claim payouts and improved quality of service at UHC.

Working with Azure/GCP, I've ensured stringent security protocols with fully compliant code for HIPAA, PHI, and PII. A results-first approach and efficient communication have been my leverage for high-impact solutions.
